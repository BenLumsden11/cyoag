    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG)</h1>
    <h2>Mystery Adventure</h2>
    
    <p><br>You stand on the edge of the clearing and cough politely. The men are in too deep asleep to hear you, and they barely stir. <br>You try again, this time louder and more insistent. One of them rolls over and mutters something under his breath, but that's it. <br/>
        Just as you consider walking across the clearing and going on your way, you notice another man returning from between the trees.<br/> He's carrying a tin filled with water from a nearby river. He places it down and looks up, spotting you easily.<br/>
        "Oh! An intruder, are you?" he asks in a gruff voice.<br/>
        You mutter something about looking for an old house and your car breaking down, and the man starts to laugh.<br/>
        "Ai, there's a lot of cars that break down out here. It's the road and humidity. The engines can't handle it. <br>I know where your house it, right enough. Come on, follow me." With that, the man stands up and heads into the trees on the opposite side of the clearing.<br/> You race after him, taking care to keep the fire between you and the slumbering oafs and catch up with him a hundred yards or so further along the track.<br/>
        "Head along here for about five minutes, and you'll be at the house. Don't step off the path, whatever happens. <br>There are far worse things out there than my buddies and me," he says before turning and leaving you alone again. </p>
