    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG)</h1>
    <h2>Mystery Adventure</h2>
    
    <p> <br>The old man leads you through knee-high bushes and between twisted trees that reach out and claw at your clothes, but you ignore all of the pain and discomfort to keep up with him. 
        <br>For somebody so old, he is incredibly sprightly, and he regularly disappears behind distant bushes or thick tree-trunks. 
        <br>Eventually, you catch up with him just as he comes to a halt in front of a wooden cottage. 
        <br>It has seen better days, but it still offers some protection from whatever is lurking in the forest.  <br>You follow the man through the front door. </p>
