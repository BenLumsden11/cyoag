    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG)</h1>
    <h2>Mystery Adventure</h2>
    
    <p><br>You turn around and stare up into the wrinkled face of an old man. He doesn't look friendly, as such, but nor is he immediately threatening. <br>If anything, he looks annoyed that he's had to rescue you.
        He offers you his hand to help you up, and you take it. <br>His skin is ice-cold and smooth to the touch, but he is surprisingly strong for somebody so small.<br>
        "Come with me," he says. "I will take you to where you need to be." Without waiting for you to answer, the man sets off along a hidden track.</p>

                    <br><li><a href="page5.html">To turn and sprint in the other direction, go to 5.</a></li>
