    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG)</h1>
    <h2>Mystery Adventure</h2>
    
    <p><br/>An ethereal wind blows through a gap in the passenger window of your car.<br/>You've tried several times to close it, but it seems like the old girl is finally starting to fall to pieces. <br/> 
        You remind yourself that it doesn't matter - as soon as you've signed the dusty old lawyer's papers, you'll be rich enough to buy whatever car you want. <br/>
        It's such a shame that you have to travel all this way, and find your way through the deserted forest, just to meet him. He did seem strangely insistent, though. <br/>
As you ponder your situation and mentally spend your new fortune, the car lurches and splutters to a stop. 
You step out and see that the engine is smoking.<br/> You give it a kick, more out of frustration than hope that it will work, and turn to look at the road ahead.<br/>
The flickering headlamps illuminate a dark road, closely bordered with leafless trees and thick clumps of nettles and ferns. A few hundred yards ahead, the road forks.<br/> 
You reach into the car and grab the map, but an unfortunate gust of wind snatches it from your grasp and steals it away into the night.<br/>
You walk as quickly as possible to the split in the road and take in each choice.<br/> 
To the left, the road seems to dip quickly and is flooded with darkness.<br/> 
To the right, the road seems flat but less well-worn.<br/> 
There is a soft, golden glow somewhere in the distance, but you can't make out whether it is a house or something more sinister.</p>
