    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG)</h1>
    <h2>Mystery Adventure</h2>
    
    <p><br>The darkness engulfs you until you can't see your own hand in front of your face. <br/>You are sure that the moon is nearly full in the sky, but there is no evidence of that as you wander lost along the road.
        <br/>Somewhere behind you, or perhaps off to one side, you hear something moving through the bracken, trying hard not to make a sound.<br/> The way the sounds echo amongst the slumbering trees makes it impossible to work out where it is coming from.<br/> You hasten your step until you are practically springing, but without being able to see where you are going, it isn't long before you trip and fall to the floor.<br/> You feel the hard grit cut into your cheek and the sharp-angled stones pressing into your chest.<br/>
        Behind you, you hear a voice whispering to you. "Come quickly. You shouldn't be out here alone. It isn't safe."</p>
