    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG)</h1>
    <h2>Mystery Adventure</h2>
    
    <p><br>Treading as lightly as you can, you step into the centre of the clearing and make your way around the fire. <br>You try to keep the flames between you and the men at all times, but you hadn't counted on the fact that one of them had disappeared to fetch water just before you arrived. <br/>
        He returns now and shouts out to wake his friends. Within seconds, they are on their feet and surrounding you. <br>They don't take kindly to strangers in their camp, and they quickly bind your hands and feet and throw you into the back of their van. 
        <br>Wherever you end up next, you won't be signing the lawyer's papers tonight.
